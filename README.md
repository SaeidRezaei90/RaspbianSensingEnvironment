# RaspbianSensingEnvironment
 There are three Raspbian application in this repository. The 'SensingEnvironment' is used to get environmental information periodically and show them on the LED display and store them in a .txt file. The 'SendEmail' do the same as previos one but send the information via email to the operator as well. In the third application 'SendNotification, I used pycurl and json libraries to establish an API connection with Instapush and send a notification to the operator If the temperature gets colder or warmer than a certain amount. In addition I devide the LED display to two region to show the temperature
